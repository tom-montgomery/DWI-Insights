# Texas Oilfield DWI-Insights

<b> What problem are we trying to solve? </b>

We want to know if the police are making DWI arrests in areas where they are needed. Are law enforcement officials putting enough resources in oilfield areas where the per capita occurence of alcohol involved injuries and death are the highest?

<b>Who will benefit (directly and indirectly) from this project?</b>

The visualization will provide insight for the police and policy makers. Alcohol related traffic fatalities are a significant public safety issue in Texas and we want to make sure that police resources are directed to areas where prevention can a difference.



<b> Software used: </b>
Currently using ArcGIS for analysis and data preperation and Numpy/Scipy for statistical analysis.


<b/> Goals for statistical/spatial analysis & mapping:</b>

- Alcohol related crash death rate per capita per county
- Alcohol related crash injury rate per capita per county
- Mapping results in informative way.
- Showing year on year trends for #1 and #2 for each county and using regression to predict upcoming stats.
- Correlating crash incidents with oil field activity.
