# DWI-Insights

<b> What problem are we trying to solve? </b>

We want to know if the police are making DWI arrests in areas where they are needed.

<b>Who will benefit (directly and indirectly) from this project?</b>

The visualization will provide insight for the police and policy makers. Alcohol related traffic fatalities are a significant public safety issue in Austin and we want to make sure that police resources are directed to areas where prevention can a difference.

<b> Software used: </b>
Currently using ArcGIS 10.3.1 (python 2x) for analysis and data prep but open to open source solutions.

<b> Data sources: </b>
Political Boundaries : TNRIS (https://tnris.org/data-download/#!/statewide)
DWI & Crash Data: TXDoT (https://cris.dot.state.tx.us/public/Query/)

<b/> Ideas for spatial analysis & mapping:</b>

- Need to figure out timeline. Data is availiable for multiple years.
- DWI death rate per capita per police agency district
- Alcohol related injury rate per capita per police agency district
- Finding ratio of arrests to crashes per police agency district and comparing to state wide
