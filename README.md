# DWI-Insights

<b> What problem are we trying to solve? </b>

We want to know if the police are making DWI arrests in areas where they are needed.

<b>Who will benefit (directly and indirectly) from this project?</b>

The visualization will provide insight for the police and policy makers. Alcohol related traffic fatalities are a significant public safety issue in Austin and we want to make sure that police resources are directed to areas where prevention can a difference.

<b> Software used: </b>
Currently using ArcGIS 10.3.1 (python 2x) for analysis and data prep but open to open source solutions.

<b> Data sources: </b>

Political Boundaries : TNRIS (https://tnris.org/data-download/#!/statewide)

DWI & Crash Data: TXDoT (https://cris.dot.state.tx.us/public/Query/)

<b/> Goals for spatial analysis & mapping:</b>

- Using data 2010-2017 from CRIS
- DWI death rate per capita per county
- Alcohol related injury rate per capita per county
- Possibly finding ratio of arrests to crashes per police county and comparing to state wide. Need to find DWI arrest record source.
- Mapping results in informative way.
- Showing year on year trends for each county and using regression to predict.
