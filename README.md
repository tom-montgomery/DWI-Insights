# DWI-Insights

# What problem are we trying to solve?

We want to know if the police are making DWI arrests in areas where they are needed.

# Who will benefit (directly and indirectly) from this project?

The visualization will provide insight for the police and policy makers. Alcohol related traffic fatalities are a significant public safety issue in Austin and we want to make sure that police resources are directed to areas where prevention can a difference.
